Pricing for delivery services is subject to change at any time based on Delivery Partner rates and our administrative costs.</p>
                <p className="mt-1"><span className="font-medium">Subscription Fees:</span> My Delivery Fleet reserves the right to implement, modify, or increase recurring subscription fees for access to the platform or specific software suites at any time.

My Delivery Fleet is not a provider of transportation services and assumes no liability for delivery performance. You acknowledge that any request for reimbursement must be submitted to the Delivery Partner through their designated channels and is subject to their independent investigation and final determination. My Delivery Fleet does not provide direct refunds for delivery-related incidents and possesses no authority to override a Delivery Partner&apos;s claim decision.</p>

                <p className="mt-1">You acknowledge that delivery instructions passed to Delivery Partners (such as &quot;Hand to me,&quot; &quot;Meet at door,&quot; or &quot;Knock and wait&quot;) are requests and not guarantees of specific performance. The Delivery Partner and their individual drivers (&quot;Delivery Persons&quot;) reserve the right to complete the delivery in accordance with their safety protocols and operational discretion. In events where a recipient is unavailable, unresponsive, or the delivery location is deemed inaccessible or unsafe, the Delivery Person may, at their sole discretion, complete the delivery by leaving the items at the safest available location (e.g., doorstep, lobby, or front desk). Such delivery shall constitute a completed service for which you remain fully liable for payment.</p>
                <p className="mt-1"><span className="font-medium">Transfer of Title:</span> You acknowledge that you relinquish title to the items upon completion of pickup by a Delivery Person, at which point title transfers directly to your customer. Neither My Delivery Fleet nor the Delivery Partner takes title to any items at any time, no bailment is created, and neither My Delivery Fleet nor the Delivery Partner acts as a bailee of your goods.</p>
                <p className="mt-1"><span className="font-medium">Catering and Large Orders:</span> If you submit requests for Catering Orders or unusually large volumes, you acknowledge that acceptance of such requests is at the sole discretion of the Delivery Persons. Delivery Persons are not required to provide any additional equipment (e.g., warming trays) or perform any inside setup or assembly of Catering Orders at the destination.</p>

                <p className="mt-1">Subject to applicable Laws, you may choose to request the delivery of items subject to age restrictions, including alcohol (&quot;Age-Restricted Items&quot;). By requesting delivery of Age-Restricted Items through the Software, you expressly agree to the following:</p>

You agree to provide proof of such Required Licenses to us or the Delivery Partner immediately upon request. My Delivery Fleet does not hold a license to sell alcohol and only facilitates connectivity; you are the sole licensed seller and controller of the sale.</li>
                  <li><span className="font-medium">Liability for Prohibited Delivery:</span> You are responsible for taking any steps necessary to inform yourself of applicable laws regarding the sale and delivery of Age-Restricted Items. You agree to limit the hours during which Age-Restricted Items are available for purchase and delivery in accordance with applicable Laws.</li>
                  <li><span className="font-medium">Packaging and Labeling:</span> You will package Age-Restricted Items appropriately for delivery, including any protection necessary to prevent tampering or damage, and any labeling required by Law (including, but not limited to, a statement that the package contains alcohol and may only be delivered to a person 21 years or older with valid proof of age and identity).</li>
                  <li><span className="font-medium">Promotions and Advertising:</span> You agree to follow all Laws and regulations related to your advertisement and promotion of Age-Restricted Items, including Federal Trade Commission guidelines and industry best practices.</li>
                  <li><span className="font-medium">Returns &amp; Return Fees:</span> You acknowledge that a Delivery Person or customer may be required to return an Age-Restricted Item to you if the Delivery Person is unable to deliver it pursuant to applicable Law (e.g., the recipient is underage, intoxicated, or unavailable). Unless prohibited by Law, you agree to accept the return of such items. You explicitly agree that you may be charged a fee for the return (the &quot;Return Fee&quot;), which you authorize My Delivery Fleet to charge to your account. You shall not be paid for returned items.</li>

                      <li><span className="font-medium">Washington:</span> Deliveries of Alcohol Items are permitted only between 6:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. You must affix a label on the outside of each package stating: (1) the package contains liquor; (2) the recipient must be 21+; and (3) delivery to intoxicated persons is prohibited.</li>

                <p className="mt-1">You shall not request delivery for any &quot;Prohibited Items&quot; or unauthorized &quot;Restricted Items&quot; as defined by the Delivery Partner&apos;s terms. You must package all items appropriately (using dry ice, gel packs, sealants, etc.) to prevent tampering, spillage, or damage. If you provide a &quot;Substandard Item&quot; (an item improperly packaged, leaking, unsafe, or non-compliant with food/health codes), you are solely responsible for its disposal. You agree to pay any and all cancellation fees, return fees, or vehicle damage/cleaning fees assessed by the Delivery Partner resulting from your Substandard or Prohibited Items.</p>
                <p className="mt-1"><span className="font-medium">Size and Weight Restrictions:</span> You agree that all Items provided to a Delivery Person must collectively fit into a standard midsize motor vehicle and must not exceed fifty (50) pounds per package, box, or parcel.
